Embedded C | ARM cortex Controller | Stepper motor Control | Motion detection (PIR sensor) | Distance Sensing (Ultrasonic sensor) 

This project is completed using Tiva C series ARM cortex M4, and integrated various sensors like PIR, ultrasonic to build mini project and to gain hands on experince with embedded C.
I used Code composer studio (CSS) platform for programming.

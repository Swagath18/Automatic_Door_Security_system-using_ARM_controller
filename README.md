# Automatic_Door_Security_system-using_ARM_controller
Embedded C | ARM cortex Controller | Stepper motor Control | Motion detection (PIR sensor) | Distance Sensing (Ultrasonic sensor) 

This project was completed using Tiva C series ARM cortex M4 controller it was the given task should be completed in 3weeks during my Summer fellowship program at Indian Institue of Science (IISc) 2018. This project involves integrating various sensors and actuators like PIR, ultrasonic, stepper motor to build mini project and to gain hands on experince with embedded C. we used Code composer studio (CSS) environment for development.
